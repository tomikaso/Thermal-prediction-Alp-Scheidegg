Since the ICON weather model is open, it is feasible to predict thermal activities for paragliders.
The main.py runs everywhere and produces an esay readable thermal chart for the starting grig "Alp Scheidegg" in Switzerland. It uses the data of the ICON-forcasting model.
The second file thermal_forecast is basically the same, but optimized for Raspberry Pi. The png's created can be exposed to a webserver easily.
